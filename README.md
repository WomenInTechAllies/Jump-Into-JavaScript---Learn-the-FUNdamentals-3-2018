# Jump Into JavaScript - learn the FUNdamentals
## Speaker : Susan Wands

## https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Tech-Allies/events/247391725/

I want to thank everyone for coming. I love seeing all you great Allies laughing and coding and learning together.  

I am adding a few things to this repo as notes and reference:
- Slides ... adding the slide deck as a PowerPoint and as a PDF (for Mac users)
- Notes ... my .js doc that has some sample code that we looked at in talking about variable scope and some other stuff
- Rainbow Project ... the little sample project at the end to try out some of the concepts we had talked through

## Continued Learning
Here are a few recommended resources for next steps in JavaScript.  If you think of any others or find some fun ones, please drop a note in the SLACK channel or in the Meetup (https://join.slack.com/t/womenintechallies/shared_invite/enQtMjc0MDY0NzI2NDg1LTI0ZDg1MjJlZmU1OWEyZWQ1ZDFiMmRkOTQ5NzU3OWViMDM3YTdmNzUxZWM0ZWFiNTZjMGMzYTlmMTU3Y2EwNjY) ...
